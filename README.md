# QGIS models and scripts for railway ground-borne noise modelling

These models were developed for the work published in the following paper:

Young, Marcus, Rempelos, Georgios, Ntotsios, Evangelos, Blainey, Simon, Thompson, David and Preston, Jonathan (2020) A transferable method for estimating the economic impacts of track interventions: application to ground-borne noise reduction measures for whole sections of route. *Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit*. (In Press)
